Handle flatpak, aur, and git application builds in arch_setup

Handle desktop and laptop configs, maybe with two different directories and applying one or the other using the toSystem script

convert arch_setup script to fish script

convert toSystem and toRepo to fish scripts that are better (integrate with the laptop/desktop configs)
