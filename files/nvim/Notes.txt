when opening { someway to quickly have the second moved two lines down and tab to corrent indentation

quick way to adjust size of windows by small amount or percentage maybe?

handle indent lines for spaces

in basher handle spaces in file names

in basher have option to set directory where script is created

make a script that lists all the applications I use on arch and installs them, I can use this for a fresh install if needed and makes sure I have everything I need

make or possibly modify basher to be able to quickly add files via cmake or have global scripts that can be used for the same thing, could add input types and allow users to do much more with basher
