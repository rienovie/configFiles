when opening { someway to quickly have the second moved two lines down and tab to corrent indentation

quick way to adjust size of windows by small amount or percentage maybe?

handle indent lines for spaces

in basher handle spaces in file names

in basher have option to set directory where script is created

make or possibly modify basher to be able to quickly add files via cmake or have global scripts that can be used for the same thing, could add input types and allow users to do much more with basher

fix when hitting modify on empty entry in basher

add jump to next/prev function

update next/prev buffer to work in insert mode

add to common.sh a way to run without locking current thread (maybe already added just need to check)

currently theme must be reloaded after supermaven initialization to change suggestion color
